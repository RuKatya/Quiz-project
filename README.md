<h2 style="color: rgb(76, 76, 155);">About the project</h2>
The project was built as a part of the study. During the project we had the freedom to choose which type of site and the topic of the project but it was important that the project be registered in React. Basides that I used MongoDB and NodeJS.

<h2 style="color: rgb(76, 76, 155);">Project creation process</h2>

In the beginning I was building a sketch of the way the site will look like by using [Diagrams](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-MvioFju07lw9E-jOv1eVpBxJKna6fTu/view?usp=sharing).
Then, I started building the web site, first the server. 
In the server I used:

- Express
- Path
- Cors
- Fetch
  
Then I built the client side in which I wrote it in React. While writing the code I used: 

- useEffect
- useState
- props
- React-router-dom and else.
